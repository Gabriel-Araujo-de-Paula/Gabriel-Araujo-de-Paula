## 🚧 Technologies I Love to Explore 🚧

Here are some of the tools I use for fun and learning:

- **🐍 Python**: My go-to for automating everyday tasks and solving engineering problems in a practical and efficient way.
- **☕ Java**: A language that helps me strengthen my programming logic and dive deeper into object-oriented concepts.
- **🌐 JavaScript**: The magic behind the web interfaces I create, bringing interactivity and life to web pages.

All of this is just for fun! Every line of code is a new discovery and an opportunity to learn something new. 🌱
